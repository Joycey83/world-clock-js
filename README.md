# World Clock App

The World Clock Application was created for the Shecodes Plus Add-on Project

## Introduction

A simple and reliable clock application with customizable color themes, dark and light mode and the ability to display the date and time of each city from various time zones.

My approach for designing this World Clock application was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The applicaion is also accessible through a range of different devices.

# Running Locally

## Live server

1.You will need node.js and npm. You should probably install this globally.

2.run the following command in your terminal:

npm install -g live-server

3.In your project directory issue the command live-server

4.This will automatically launch the default browser. When you make a change to any file, the browser will reload the page - unless it was a CSS file in which case the changes are applied without a reload.
