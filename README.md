# World Clock App

The World Clock Application was created for the Shecodes Plus Add-on Project

## Introduction

A simple and reliable clock application with customizable color themes, dark and light mode and the ability to display the date and time from various time zones.

My approach for designing this World Clock application was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The applicaion is also accessible through a range of different devices.
